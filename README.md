Task 1: Software configuration

Subtask 1: Why did I choose to participate in the Dare IT challenge?

Hi, mi name is Valeriia. 

I've always been searching for opportunities to grow professionally and personally. So this is how I came to try myself into the IT industry that is rapidly growing. 

One of the biggest cons of the Dare IT Challenge for me is that I can communicate in my native language with Ukrainians like me that fled from russian aggression and had to start from scratch in a new place. 
The next con for me is the program is free, the tasks are in English(which also helps me to sustain my language level). 
While doing the first task, one more con to be added - mentors are nice and patient towards their students, which is extremely helpful while doing your first steps in the new sphere. 

From the project, I expect to get some basic skills for my future job and to see how it's organized within.  

At the moment my expectations are absolutely fulfilled  :)
